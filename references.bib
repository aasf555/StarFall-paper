  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show how particle scale simulation of industrial particle flows using DEM (discrete element method) offers the opportunity for better understanding of the flow dynamics leading to improvements in equipment design and operation.The paper explores the breadth of industrial applications that are now possible with a series of case studies.The paper finds that the inclusion of cohesion, coupling to other physics such fluids, and its use in bubbly and reacting flows are becoming increasingly viable. Challenges remain in developing models that balance the depth of the physics with the computational expense that is affordable and in the development of measurement and characterization processes to provide this expanding array of input data required. Steadily increasing computer power has seen model sizes grow from thousands of particles to many millions over the last decade, which steadily increases the range of applications that can be modelled and the complexity of the physics that can be well represented.The paper shows how better understanding of the flow dynamics leading to improvements in equipment design and operation can potentially lead to large increases in equipment and process efficiency, throughput and/or product quality. Industrial applications can be characterised as large, involving complex particulate behaviour in typically complex geometries. The critical importance of particle shape on the behaviour of granular systems is demonstrated. Shape needs to be adequately represented in order to obtain quantitative predictive accuracy for these systems.},

  abstract = {A multiple-time step computational approach is presented for efficient discrete-element modeling of aerosol flows containing adhesive solid particles. Adhesive aerosol particulates are found in numerous dust and smoke contamination problems, including smoke particle transport in the lungs, particle clogging of heat exchangers in construction vehicles, industrial nanoparticle transport and filtration systems, and dust fouling of electronic systems and MEMS components. Dust fouling of equipment is of particular concern for potential human occupation on dusty planets, such as Mars. The discrete-element method presented in this paper can be used for prediction of aggregate structure and breakup, for prediction of the effect of aggregate formation on the bulk fluid flow, and for prediction of the effects of small-scale flow features (e.g., due to surface roughness or MEMS patterning) on the aggregate formation. After presentation of the overall computational structure, the forces and torques acting on the particles resulting from fluid motion, particle--particle collision, and adhesion under van der Waals forces are reviewed. The effect of various parameters of normal collision and adhesion of two particles are examined in detail. The method is then used to examine aggregate formation and particle clogging in pipe and channel flow.},

  abstract = {The discrete element method (DEM) is developed in this study as a general and robust technique for unified two-dimensional modelling of the mechanical behaviour of solid and particulate materials, including the transition from solid phase to particulate phase. Inter-element parameters (contact stiffnesses and failure criteria) are theoretically established as functions of element size and commonly accepted material parameters including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, ultimate tensile strength, and fracture toughness. A main feature of such an approach is that it promises to provide convergence with refinement of a DEM discretization. Regarding contact failure, an energy criterion based on the material's ultimate tensile strength and fracture toughness is developed to limit the maximum contact forces and inter-element relative displacement. This paper also addresses the issue of numerical stability in DEM computations and provides a theoretical method for the determination of a stable time-step. The method developed herein is validated by modelling several test problems having analytic solutions and results show that indeed convergence is obtained. Moreover, a very good agreement with the theoretical results is obtained in both elastic behaviour and fracture. An example application of the method to high-speed penetration of a concrete beam is also given. Copyright {\copyright} 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
